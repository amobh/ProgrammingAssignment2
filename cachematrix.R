## Write a short comment describing this function

# The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to

# set the value of the matrix
# get the value of the matrix
# set the value of the inverse of matrix
# get the value of the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        inv <-matrix() 
        # set the value of the matrix
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        # get the value of the matrix
        get <- function() x
        # set the value of the inverse of matrix
        setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
        # get the value of the inverse of the matrix
        getinverse <- function() inv
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

# The following function calculates the inverse of the "matrix" created with the above function.
# However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
# If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
# Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and sets the value of the inverse 
# in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        inv <- x$getinverse()
        if(!all(is.na(inv))) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(inv)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        inv <- solve(data)
        x$setinverse(inv)
        inv
}
